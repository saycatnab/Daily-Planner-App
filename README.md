# Daily Planner Application
Using jQuery logic to make a daily planner to write down tasks for each hour of the day.

# Description

I have been given a starter code with a html file with the necessary elements and css file with the styling of the application.
Using the starter code, I have used jQuery logic to do the following:
- Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

- Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

- Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

- Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

- Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

- Persist events between refreshes of a page.

Please check the index.js to see the source code
Please check the Deployed Application (https://saycatnab.github.io/Daily-Planner-App/) to see the console.
